      <p>Hi there. My name is Cody Clegg. I recieved a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 2016, after which I worked in factory automation and electrical systems testing for a major vehicle manufacturer for a few years and discovered a passion for software development. I am now transitioning into web development to further pursue my interests.</p>
      <p>My engineering background has taught me what I believe is the most useful skill one can learn--solving problems effectively. Through my engineering training, I have learned to solve many different types of problems and from multiple angles. I feel confident that this will help me in my ability to develop robust and meaningful applications and websites.</p>
      <p>Thank you for visiting my website and please feel free to drop me a line at my <a href="contact.html" style="color: #4aaaa5;">Contact Page</a>!</p>
